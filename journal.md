To be honest, all I want to do is learn how to code. The programming languages Python, Java, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, etc sound pretty cool. I have a sort of interest in Architecture and Interior Design, so the Software Design and Architecture sound pretty chill. I don't really know any jobs that I would like. I just want to make enough money to be able to enjoy the things I actually like to do, so I don't know any jobs to pick.

I am working on the first module, Python Essentials 1, of the Python Certificate Course. I am learning the absolute basics right now. Basically what makes a language, what is the difference between a natural language and a machine language, how a computer takes simple commands like a dog would, and how computers themselves need a program to run. All computers of different sizes have different languages and programs that make up the computer.
