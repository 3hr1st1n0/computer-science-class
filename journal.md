To be honest, all I want to do is learn how to code. The programming languages Python, Java, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, etc sound pretty cool. I have a sort of interest in Architecture and Interior Design, so the Software Design and Architecture sound pretty chill. I don't really know any jobs that I would like. I just want to make enough money to be able to enjoy the things I actually like to do, so I don't know any jobs to pick.

I am working on the first module, Python Essentials 1, of the Python Certificate Course. I am learning the absolute basics right now. Basically what makes a language, what is the difference between a natural language and a machine language, how a computer takes simple commands like a dog would, and how computers themselves need a program to run. All computers of different sizes have different languages and programs that make up the computer.

I found out the difference between compilation and interpretation. 
Compilation - The source program is translated once (however, this act must be repeated each time you modify the source code) by getting a file (e.g., an .exe file if the code is intended to be frun under MS Windows)  continuing the machine code; now you can distribute the file worldwide; the program that performs this translatino is called a piler or translator. 
Interpretation - You (or any user of code) can translate the source program each time it has to be run; the program performing this kind of transformation is called an interpreter, as it interprets the code every time it is intended to be executed; it also means that you cannot just distribute the source code as- is, because the end user also needs the interpreter to execute it.

I found out that an interpreter can inform me where the error is located and what caused it, but this can be very misleading.

I have finally finished the first Module of Python Essentials 1. I took the test and got an 90%. I have also learned how to do 
print("Hello World!")
# September 8th, 2023
Today, I have finally started learning what a function and a string is! This is something I've been wanting to learn for awhile. Totally great. Totally. 
# September 12th, 2023
Today, I am learning about print() errors.  I am learning what the effect the print() function causes. 
# September 13th, 2023
I am finally coding and using different arguments. Yay!
# September 18th, 2023
The print() function is a built-in function. It prints and outputs a specified message to the screen/console window. Built-in functions, contrary to user-defined, are always available and don't have to be imported.

I'm on Section 3 of Module 2. This module is EXTREMELY LONG, I SWEAR.

I am now on Module 3

I am starting to use vex code.
